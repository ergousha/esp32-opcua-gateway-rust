//! The Jobs state machine: what the device does with each Jobs message.
//!
//! An update is reported SUCCEEDED by the image it installed, never by the one
//! that downloaded it: until the new image has reached AWS IoT and marked
//! itself valid, the bootloader can still roll it back. So a boot that
//! installs an update ends with the execution IN_PROGRESS and the job recorded
//! in NVS ([`Store`]), and the next boot *settles* it: SUCCEEDED from the
//! new image, FAILED "rolled back" from the previous one.
//!
//! Until the Jobs service has acknowledged that outcome, no other job is
//! taken. In particular the same execution, which the service offers again at
//! boot because it is still IN_PROGRESS, is never downloaded a second time.
//! A job for the version already running is settled the same way, without a
//! download, and so is a job this firmware refuses, as REJECTED.
//!
//! Written against [`Transport`], [`Store`] and [`Installer`] so that it runs
//! on the host: the firmware plugs in MQTT, NVS and the OTA partitions
//! (`src/jobs.rs`), the tests below plug in fakes.
