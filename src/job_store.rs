//! The OTA job whose outcome is still open, kept across the reboot.
//!
//! The image that installs an update cannot know whether it will work, so it
//! records the job here and the next boot reads it back to report the outcome
//! (`gateway_core::jobs::settle`). The record is written after the image is
//! verified but before it is activated, so the new image can never boot
//! without it: a power cut any earlier leaves the running image active, and
//! the Jobs service simply offers the job again.
//!
//! Next to it, the number of downloads of a job started so far
//! (`gateway_core::jobs::DownloadAttempts`): a download that crashes the device
//! leaves nothing else behind, and without the count would start again at
//! every boot.
//!
//! It lives in the default `nvs` partition, next to the device identity, not
//! in the `opcua` one: it is a few hundred bytes written once per update, and
//! has nothing to do with the OPC UA configuration that partition caches.
